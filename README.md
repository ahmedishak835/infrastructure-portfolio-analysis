# Infrastructure Portfolio Analysis: Cost, Delivery, & Satisfaction

## 💡 Executive Summary
This project analyzes a mock infrastructure portfolio to identify key drivers of cost overruns, schedule delays, and stakeholder satisfaction issues. The analysis focuses on leveraging **SQL** to transform raw project data into actionable business intelligence, demonstrating an ability to drive strategic recommendations from complex data.

## 🎯 Key Findings & Insights
* [cite_start]**Financial Risk Hotspot:** The **Transport** sector shows the highest average cost variance (£20m) [cite: 25] [cite_start]and volatility, with projects in one region exceeding **600%** over budget[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]**The Delay Threshold:** Delays significantly impact stakeholder satisfaction, with a noticeable decline observed after approximately **180 days**[cite: 4, 39].
* [cite_start]**Quality Over Speed:** **Energy** projects maintain high satisfaction scores (e.g., a score of 9.0 in the South region [cite: 14][cite_start]) despite varied delays, suggesting that quality and successful outcomes are more critical than speed in this sector[cite: 5, 17].
* [cite_start]**Regional Bottlenecks:** The **North** region faces the longest average delays (**114 days**), indicating potential process or resource bottlenecks requiring targeted intervention[cite: 6].

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations
1.  [cite_start]**Cost Control & Forecasting:** Implement risk-weighted budgeting to account for sector volatility and strengthen early-stage cost estimation[cite: 8, 30, 31].
2.  [cite_start]**Schedule Assurance:** Introduce mid-project governance gates to reduce schedule slippage and use delay benchmarks to trigger escalation protocols[cite: 9, 34, 35].
3.  [cite_start]**Predictive Analytics:** Use predictive analytics to flag likely overruns and long delays before escalation, supporting proactive decision-making[cite: 11, 41].

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology
* [cite_start]**Data Retrieval & Aggregation:** SQL (used for all core sector- and region-level aggregation)[cite: 1, 13, 14].
* [cite_start]**Visualization & Reporting:** Excel, PowerPoint, Power BI (used for generating insights and the final deliverable)[cite: 1, 42].
